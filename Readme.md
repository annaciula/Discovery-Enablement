# This is the repo for facilitation notes for the Discovery Session Enablement.

We decided to use GitHub to keep the version controlled.
It is still work in progress and needs to be updated and reviewed.
For contributions please fork the repo and raise a PR.  For any updates and ideas, please raise an issue.  

An HTML offline version of this repo can be produced with pandoc and git style css as required using the following command:

```
pandoc -c gh.css -s facilitation.md -o facilitation.html
```
