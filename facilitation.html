<h2 id="facilitator-guide">Facilitator Guide</h2>
<blockquote>
This guide is a working document intended to evolve inline with the Discovery Session Enablement. Please share your thoughts and ideas on how to make it better. Add them as issues to the <a href="https://GitHub.com">repository</a> and they will be incorporated.
<p>
<p>This document was created to acompany the face to face <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1U_EBLS3NX0cW-Rt1-ai5bjW4JYPUh_0RFjgD843oMrY/edit?ts=5e7e0ef7#slide=id.g7f0efe6533_0_568">Discovery Session Enablement Slide Deck</a>. Most of the practices used can be found in the <a href="https://openpracticelibrary.com/">Open Practice Library</a>. The Customer Canvas have been inspired by the Discovery Map of the <a href="https://mobiusloop.com/kit/">Mobius Toolkit</a>.</p>

<li>Attend a subsequent Enablement again but shadow the Facilitator team with some opportunities to present.</li>
<li>Be a primary facilitator on a subsequent Enablement.</li>

<h2 id="other-considerations"><a id="Logistics"></a>Other considerations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Think about the summary of the Enablement, a short video or collection of pictures may be a good idea. You may want to bring a special camera like GoPro. Do not forget to capture the whole Team photo for the summary.</li>
<li>Catering during the day, Team Dinner or social event at the end of day 1. Advanced booking may be required.</li>
<li>Lots of writable wall/windows space for different canvas and Team exercises</li>
<li>Projector that supports HDMI</li>
<li>Ability to play sound from laptop</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="room-set-up"><a id="Room_Set-up"></a>Room Set-up</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Setting-up the room will require time, so bear that in mind before planning the Enablement. Ideally you will be able to access the room a day before or at least 1 hour before the Enablement starts. Following canvas should be created and populated accordingly if required:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><h4 id="agile-agenda">Agile Agenda</h4></li>
</ul>
<p>Use 127x76mm sticky notes to build backlog with agenda items. Activities should match sections of the enablement planned for two days e.g.</p>
<pre><code>- Kick off

- Team Forming &amp; Social Contract
- Discovery Session Agenda and Customer Canvas
- Why Canvas
- Who Canvas
- Pains &amp; Gains Canvas

<li><a href="https://www.funretrospectives.com/collaborative-face-drawing/">Colaborative Face Drawing</a> - The collaborative face drawing is a fun interactive activity that helps with name memorization.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>Running the activity:
---------------------
Give each participant a A5 sticky note and a pen. Instruct the participants to write their name on the bottom of the paper

Ask everyone to find someone they haven&#39;t met before and talk to them. Instruct the pair to exchange the papers

Everyone should draw the other person eyes.Instruct the pairs to exchange the papers again
(now each person should have the paper with their name again)

Repeat steps 3 to 8 for all face parts
(eyes, noise, ears, chin, hair, facial hair and accessories)</code></pre>

<li><a href="https://www.funretrospectives.com/esvp-explorer-shopper-vacationer-prisoner/">ESVP – Explorer, Shopper, Vacationer, Prisoner</a> - This is a short activity to measure participants’ engagement for the meeting at hand</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>Running the activity
---------------------
1. Ask each participant to assign themselves a role in the enablement as an Explorer, Shopper, Vacationer or Prisoner.

– Explorers – Are eager to discover new ideas and insights.
They want to learn everything they can about the discovery session.

– Shoppers – Will look over all the available information,
and will be happy to go home with one useful new idea.

– Vacationers – Aren’t interested in the work of the enablement,
but are happy to be away from the daily grind.

– Prisoners – Feel that they’ve been forced to attend
and would rather be doing something else.

2. Acknowledge the results and guide a discussion about what the results mean for the group</code></pre>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><a href="https://www.funretrospectives.com/visual-phone/">Visual phone</a> - Visual phone is a great energizer to get everyone engaged while fostering a conversation about communication and interpretations.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>Running the activity
---------------------

Break the large group into groups of three people
(one or two groups can have four people)

Place three post it and a pen in front of each person
Ask everyone to write a sentence (on a post it),
then place a blank post it on top of it
(for now only the sentence author knows it)

Everyone pass the post it clockwise
Each person read the sentence from the post it in front of  them,
and then create a representative drawing for the sentence (on the blank post it)
Everyone pass the post it clockwise.

On a new post it, each person write a sentence for the drawing in front of them,
and place it on top of the post it set (now the set has 3 post its; the original sentence, the drawing, and the new sentence)

Everyone pass the post it set clockwise (for the groups of three people, the set should end in front of the original sentence writer)
Open the post it set so everyone can see the sentences and respective drawings.

This is a great energizer with a sublime massage about communication (visual and written), context and interpretations.</code></pre>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Agile Animals a.k.a. Spirit Animals - great short activity that can be combined with introductions.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>Running the activity
---------------------
Draw a simple representation of an animal that you feel represents your current mood. Hang on to these.

Introduce yourself to the group and share your animal.
- What is your name?
- Where are you from?
- What is your current role in your organization?
- Show and Tell: your animal drawing</code></pre>

<h3 id="start-at-the-end">1. Start at the End</h3>
<p>Start by imagining your end result and risks along the way. Then work backward to figure out the steps you’ll need to get there.</p>
<h4 id="facilitation-steps">Facilitation steps</h4>
<p>
<p><strong>Set a long term goal. Get <em>optimistic</em> hat:</strong> (15 mins)<br> <strong><em>Ask:</em></strong> Why are we here today and what does success looks like to us? Where do we want to be in six months (short term goal), a year, or even five years (long term goal) from now?</pr></p>
<p>
<p><strong>List questions. Get <em>pessimistic</em> hat.</strong> (15 mins)<br> <strong><em>Ask:</strong></em> How could we fail? What do we need to do to get there think backward steps. Facilitator tips: Turn these fears into questions and list those questions in the whiteboard.</pr></p>
<p>
<p><strong>Cluster:</strong> (10 mins)<br> Ask the team to cluster and group them in short term vs long term goal</pr></p>
<p>
<strong>Draw a map:</strong> (20 mins)<br> Finally draw backwards on a map of a system, journey starting from the end goal
</p>
<h4 id="facilitator-guide-strategy">Facilitator Guide: Strategy</h4>
<pre><code>- When defining what success looks like, it may be helpful to focus on goal setting from the perspective of the customer and business.
Identify what value or success looks likes for your customer. Then define what value you are looking to achieve for your business.
- The technique forces participants to think about failure, which many teams never do.
It’s surprising how much you can learn about a domain just by getting participants to share their fears.
- It’s easy to communicate the results of the session in slide ware and project rooms.
We’d recommend keeping the results up in the project space throughout your effort.</code></pre>

<h3 id="cover-story">2. Cover Story</h3>
<p>Cover story is a Design Thinking practice forces participants to start with the end mindset.</p>
<p>The team is encouraged to visualise, image and even sketch their wildest ideas and plant seeds for the future state of the organisation so spectacular that they have put the business on the cover of a well-known magazine.</p>
<h4 id="facilitation-steps-1">Facilitation steps</h4>
<ul>
<li>Divide the team into 4-6 people</li>
<li>Draw out large-scale templates that include the categories as listed in the image.</li>
<li>Define each category on the template</li>
<li>Diverge: Ask the team to populate the template with the sticky note and write and draw together (5-10 mins)</li>
<li>Emerge: Ask the team to quietly imagine their best case scenario story relates to them quietly - (5 mins)</li>
<li>Converge: Ask the team to agree on one one topic and generate the “story of the year” and represent it on their team collaboratively. (30 - 45 mins)</li>
<li>Discuss: Ask in the room what they observed, any insights and concerns about the future state (5-10 mins)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="facilitator-guide-strategy-1">Facilitator Guide: Strategy</h4>
<pre><code>This game is about the wildest dream for the organization—that has already happened!
So, when you set up this game as the meeting leader, speak about their “successes” with enthusiasm and in the past tense.
Encourage the players to use the past tense in their brainstorming and story creation. And don’t let the group go into analysis mode.
This game is not about logic, pragmatism, or parameters.

Cover Story is an open-ended, creative-thinking exercise, so tell the players to be wary of any “reality checks” from other players.
And as the small groups present their visions to the large group, note and discuss any common themes that arise.
These themes—however fantastical—are telling, because commonalities reveal shared hopes and also plant seeds for real possibilities.
If this play is part of a longer group process, post these visions around the room so that they serve as reference points for continued
ideas and inspiration.</code></pre>
